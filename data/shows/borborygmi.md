  Essay by Danielle Avram


  The term “borborygmi” refers to the peristaltic rumblings of the digestive system. 


  Created by fluid and gas moving through the intestines via rhythmic contractions, the noises are indicative of naturally occurring processes, as food consumption and break down (or the lack thereof) affects auditory output. Often referred to as the “second brain,” the digestive track has a long history of being misunderstood, and even today – particularly with industrialized food production and genetic modification – the relationship between food intake and emotional, physical, and mental well-being is subjective and speculative. The works of Luke Harnden function similarly to borborygmi. The artist uses highly intuitive, systematic, processes to break down worldly information into visual noise that, above all else, is concerned with the collective versus individual of human existence. 


  A child of the 1980s, Harnden’s practice is heavily influenced by the technological and cultural revolutions of the decade, particularly the rise of the information superhighway. Steeped in the sort of self-made mythologies that accompany youthful insularity, his work encapsulates the disillusionment many of us of that era (the so-called “Cuspers” who float between Gen X and Millennial) feel, our formative years spent in the perpetual collision of the old and the new, a series of last gasps and lurches forward, the promise of “something better” always on the horizon. We are neither our prideful, God-fearing predecessors, nor have the savvy idealism of our successors. Wedged between the two, we are the magical realists, or perhaps, the realists who are still searching for the magical.


  It’s no wonder then that Harnden’s practice centers on teasing out meaning in the intangible. Elegantly crude, the works are exercises in dissection, rearrangement, and reanimation – Frankensteinian meshes of man and machine. His paintings are generated using an algorithmic process that expands simple gestures into complex visual arrangements. Using handmade stencils to overlay moire patterns on canvases thickly lacquered with acrylic paint, the artist creates digital-looking skins that split as the paint dries, literally breaking down the real and the virtual. Further expanding on this process, Harnden’s more recent paintings incorporate collages of mass-market photos that have been spliced apart and rearranged, peeking out from behind the same fuzzy pattern like ghostly images materializing in television static.


  A series of sign paintings more directly references consumer culture, featuring iconic logos reduced to studies in shape and color. Using a process similar to monotyping, Harnden paints the signs on plastic sheeting, later transferring them to canvas so the backside becomes exposed, the paint rendered soft and pulpy, like the fading of a graphic on a worn t-shirt. Stripped of their cool commerciality, the signs become cultural artifacts, handcrafted odes to the ubiquitous. It’s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the paradoxical nature of advertising as a representation of both the individual and the collective: the mass production of ideologies which are then co-opted as personal statements, the messages becoming worn or obsolete with the passage of time.


  Similarly, Harnden’s sculptures function as exercises in degradation, addressing the breakdown between original and facsimile, and the inherent instability of information processing. Created by carving, burning, and staining stacks of paper into totemic, wizard-like, figures, the sculptures exist simultaneously as originals and multiples, with the initial form serving as the prototype for each successive copy. The resolution deteriorates with each new iteration, similar to image compression loss or rasterized pixilation. The pieces address the issue of mechanical reproduction – as it applies to both fabricating art objects as well as rendering three-dimensional objects into two-dimensional photographs – particularly prescient given that the likelihood of artworks being viewed solely through smartphone and computer screens grows increasingly higher.


  Accompanying Harnden’s work is a selection of six drawings by the late Dallas-based artist, John Wilcox. Known for his introverted practice that spawned a deeply personal visual language, Wilcox found his artistic footing during a two year sojourn to the California coastal town of Carpinteria in the early 1980s, deliberately sequestering himself from the art world so he could better listen to his own intuition. Made during that time, the drawings feature hundreds of small repetitive marks, tightly arranged and layered into dense black squares. Like Harnden’s algorithmic paintings, Wilcox’s drawings employ a systematic process of recursion to create undulating patterns that shift within themselves in endless feedback loops.


  Similarly frustrated as Harnden, Wilcox was caught between two worlds: his desire to be an artist and his small town Texas roots. He shifted between New York, California, and his home state, struggling with finding his place while dealing with his own insecurities and self-doubts. Living in New York City during the peak of the AIDS crisis, Wilcox witnessed the deaths of many of his contemporaries, and endured a lengthy battling with HIV himself, before passing in 2012. Knowing this, his mark making becomes an act of meditative quantification, a therapy of sorts for marking the passage of time and people. Or perhaps it is an internal rumination of the process of biological destruction, cells caught in a never-ending war with each other, the resulting black masses borborygmi expelled into the world. For both Wilcox and Harnden the ultimate struggle is whether or not the whole is actually greater than the sum of its parts – the push-and-pull between the individual and the collective, and the grasping for a synergy that can be felt, but remains forever slightly out of reach.
